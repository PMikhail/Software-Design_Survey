Phillipotair MikhailCS350 A3ReadMe FileThis is Assignment 1 Part 3 of the CS course Software Design (CS350). There are a total 16 Java files in this .zip folder. I used the serialization method to implement loading and saving of a survey/test. For sample files, absolute paths is not being used. Sample files are saved in the following folders:Assignment3/Surveys/ ...for survey type questions, and Assignment3/Tests/ ...for test type questions. The surveys/tests will save accordingly. When the user runs the program, it will display two options, Survey and Test. If the user enters the improper/invalid input, the program will display a warning message until the user has entered a valid input (1 or 2). After this it will display eight or nine options depending upon the user's initial input. Next, the user must follow the steps to create, load, display, save, modify, take, or tabulate a survey/test. When a user enters the load survey/est, it will allow the user to select a saved survey/test. Each sample file has each type of questions. If user desires to exit the program, he may select option 8 in survey, and option 9 in test.
