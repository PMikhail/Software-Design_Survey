Phillipotair MikhailCS350 A2ReadMe FileThis is Assignment 2 of the CS course Software Design (CS350). There are a total 11 Java files in this .zip folder. I used the serialization method to implement loading and saving of a survey/test. For sample files, absolute paths is not being used. Sample files are saved in the folder Assignment2/Surveyfolder/surveying for survey type questions, and Assignment2/Testfolder/testing for test type questions. The survey/test will save accordingly. When the user runs the program, it will display two options, Survey and Test. If the user enters the improper/invalid input, the program will display a warning message until the user has entered a valid input (1 or 2). After this it will display five survey options depending upon the user's initial input. Next, the user must follow the steps to create survey/test, load survey/test, display survey/test, and save a survey/test. When a user enters the load survey, it will give two sample survey samplesurvey and survey1, and one file in load test test1. Each sample file has each type of questions. If user desires to exit the program, he may select option 5.
